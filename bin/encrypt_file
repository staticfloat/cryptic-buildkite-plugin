    Congratulations, you have successfully encrypted a secret.

    The file has been encrypted into the path '${FILE_PATH}.encrypted'.

# Check to see if the unencrypted file is `.gitignored` already:
if ! git -C "${REPO_ROOT}" check-ignore -q "${REPO_ROOT}/${FILE_PATH}"; then
    # If it hasn't been, add it to a `.gitignore` automatically

        It appears that it was previously checked into this repository; we highly recommend
        deleting its history to truly eliminate it.  We suggest using a tool such as the
        excellent 'git-filter-repo' to do this: https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo

    cat <<-EOD

    We have automatically added a rule to ${GITIGNORE_PATH} to ignore the unencrypted
    file in the future, please verify that the ignore pattern is as you wish it to be.

    Add the following plugin stanza to the step you want to have access to the secret.
    Be sure to minimize the number of steps that have access to this secret information, as
    for true security you should lock down the CI configuration through treehashing your
    repository's pipeline.yaml files.  See the top-level README.md for more information on
    locking down CI configuration and next steps.

    plugins:
        - staticfloat/cryptic:
          files:
            - ${FILE_PATH}
